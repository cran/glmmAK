    \code{\link{cumlogitRE}} used to obtain the MCMC output}
  \item{cluster}{vector defining pertinence of the single observations to
    clusters. It is useful when we want to predict longitudinal profiles.

%    lengths or numbers of rows of arguments \code{betaF}, \code{betaR}, \code{varR}}
  \item{betaF}{sampled values of the fixed effects. This should be a
    (sub)sample from the MCMC output stored in the file \file{betaF.sim}}
  \item{betaR}{sampled values of the mean of random effects. This should be a
    (sub)sample from the MCMC output stored in the file \file{betaR.sim}

    It is only needed if \code{hierar.center} is \code{TRUE}.
  }  
  \item{varR}{sampled values of either (co)variance matrices or
    precision (matrices) for random effects if there are any. This
    should be a (sub)sample of either the first or second half of the
    columns stored in the file \file{varR.sim}}
  \item{is.varR}{logical indicating whether \code{varR} gives
    (co)variance (\code{is.varR} \code{TRUE}) or precisions (inverse
    variances) (\code{is.varR} \code{FALSE})}
  \item{prior.gspline}{if \code{drandom} is \bold{gspline} this is a list
    specifying the G-splines. It should have the same structure as the

    output. However, it is satisfactory if the items
    \bold{K}, \bold{delta} and \bold{sigma} are given.}
  \item{probs}{probabilities for which the (pointwise) sample quantiles
    of the predictive probabilities should be computed.

    If not given only average (and values) of the predictive
    probabilities are computed}
  \item{values}{if \code{TRUE} also values of the predictive
    probabilities at each (MCMC) iteration are returned.

    If \code{FALSE} only sample mean (and quantiles) of the predictive
    probabilities  are returned}  
  \item{dir}{character giving the directory where the file with (sampled)
    G-spline (log-)weights is stored.

    Needed only if \code{drandom} is \bold{gspline}.
  }
  \item{wfile}{character giving the name of the file with (sampled)
    G-spline (log-)weights.

    Needed only if \code{drandom} is \bold{gspline}. In most cases, for
    \bold{univariate} G-spline this argument will be equal to
    \dQuote{\code{logweight.sim}}
    and for \bold{bivariate} G-spline equal to \dQuote{\code{weight.sim}}.
  }
  \item{indfile}{character giving the name of the file where we stored
    indeces of these G-spline components for which the weights are
    stored in the file given by \code{wfile}. The corresponding file
    should have the same structure as \file{knotInd.sim} created by
    \code{\link{cumlogitRE}}.

    Needed only if \code{is.indfile} is \code{TRUE}. In most cases, for
    \bold{univariate} G-spline it does not have to be specified and for
    \bold{bivariate} G-spline it will be equal to \dQuote{\code{knotInd.sim}}.
  }  
  \item{header}{logical indicating whether the files \code{wfile}, \code{indfile}

  \item{logw}{logical indicating whether the file \code{wfile} contains
    logarithms of the weights.

    Needed only if \code{drandom} is \bold{gspline}. In most cases, for
    \bold{univariate} G-spline it will be \code{TRUE} and for
    \bold{bivariate} G-spline it will be \code{FALSE}.
  }
  \item{is.indfile}{logical.

    If \code{TRUE} then \code{wfile} contains
    only the non-zero weights and the G-spline is reconstructed using
    \code{indfile}.

    If \code{FALSE} then \code{wfile} must contain on
    each row weights of all components and \code{indfile} is ignored.

    Needed only if \code{drandom} is \bold{gspline} and random effects
    are bivariate.
  } 
  \item{skip}{number of data rows that should be skipped at the beginning of
    the files \code{wfile}, \code{indfile}.

    progress of computation (every \code{nwrite}th iteration count of
    iterations change)}

\value{
  A list with the following components (description below applies for
  the case with \code{prob=0.5})
  \item{Mean}{a matrix with \eqn{C+1} columns giving in each row
    posterior predictive mean of category probabilities
    \eqn{\mbox{P}(Y=0),\ldots,\mbox{P}(Y=C)}{P(Y=0),\ldots,P(Y=C)} for
    a given covariate combination.

  \item{50\%}{a matrix with \eqn{C+1} columns giving in each row
    posterior predictive quantile (here 50\% quantile) of category
    probabilities for a given covariate combination.

    There is one component of this type in the resulting \code{list}
    for each value of \code{probs}.
  }
  \item{values}{a matrix with \eqn{(C+1)n}{(C+1)*n} columns, where
    \eqn{n} denotes the number of covariate combinations for which we
    perform the prediction, and number of rows equal to the length of
    the MCMC. The first \eqn{C+1} columns give sampled category
    probabilities for the first covariate combination, the second
    \eqn{C+1} columns give sampled category probabilities for the second
    covariate combination etc.

    It is returned only if \code{values} is \code{TRUE}.
